# brave_binary

Download, and get the executable to, the latest stable build of Brave.

## Why Brave Instead of Chromium

First, it's "un-googled", and second, the builds easier to get, and third, from an API perspective, they are the same.

## Known Issues

- Requires `unzip` (or `PowerShell Expand-Archive` on windows) to be installed
- All that extra output from `unzip` can be annoying at times
